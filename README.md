whs-machine-learning
====================

Simple machine learning algorithms implemented in python during a class at 
Winchester High School.

Operating Instructions
----------------------
Each directory is a separate project.

Artificial neural nets - `ann` - a form of function approximation learning. 
The project includes a neural net for optical character recognition. Run 
`ann/ocr_gui.py` for the character recognition demo.

Genetic algorithms - `ga` - optimize a given function. The hungarian 
algorithm - `ha` - is a specific algorithm to maximally select elements of a 
matrix. We used it in combination with a genetic algorithm to create `mathteam`, 
a program to optimize math team performance.

Hidden markov models - `hmm` - perform pattern recognition. From an extracted 
model, the Viterbi algorithm allows prediction of underlying states from 
observed states.

Decision trees - `tree` - classify and predict from learned data. We applied 
the decision tree program to car buyers, the census, congressional voting 
records, and CPU performance data.
